# USC HPC Slurm Templates

Since we constantly interact with HPC for training and testing models, this repo serves as a collection for best
practises to submit python jobs to HPC using slurm. If you see anything here that is not a best practise/was a 
best practise but has now been changed, please let me know or create a pull request to update it.

## Slurm Templates

In this repo you can find the slurm templates for a single job submission, and an array job submission. The DMTCP job 
submission checkpoint script is still in the work.
